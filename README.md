# KerbalKockpit
A custom control panel for Kerbal Space Program. Heavily cribbed from PeteWasEre

This repository is a place for me to keep and share my code, designs and data for my custom KSP Control Panel.

The contents are:

1. Arduino Code - The modules that run on the Arduino Duemilanove
2. Documentation - Doesn't exist yet!
3. Enclosure Design - The printed graphics used on the panels. Designed to print to a Glowforge
4. PCB design - what it says on the tin.
5. Python Code - The python module that runs at the PC end of the link

If it helps you then please use it. Better yet, consult the original.
